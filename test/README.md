# Test Documentation
## Introduction
This **test** folder contains test cases and relative assistant tools for testing **WebNN API**.

According to [API Documentation](https://github.com/intel/webml-polyfill/blob/master/docs/api.md) and [API Info](https://github.com/intel/webml-polyfill/blob/master/src/nn/Enums.js), these test cases including:
* [**Unit Tests**](https://github.com/intel/webml-polyfill/tree/master/test/unit-test) in `unit-test` folder, checking Interface, Attribute and Method to ensure meet its design and behaves as intended
* [**CTS (Compatibility Test Suite) Tests**](https://github.com/intel/webml-polyfill/tree/master/test/cts) in `cts` folder, focus on testing behaves of [supported ops](https://github.com/intel/webml-polyfill/blob/master/docs/supported_ops.md), checking compatibility on cross platforms
* [**End-to-End Tests**](https://github.com/intel/webml-polyfill/tree/master/test/end2end-test) in `end2end-test` folder, testing using [ONNX models and sample data](https://github.com/intel/webml-polyfill/blob/master/test/end2end-test/README.md), checking model flow being performed as intended
* [**Real Model Tests**](https://github.com/intel/webml-polyfill/tree/master/test/realmodel-test) in `realmodel-test` folder, testing behaves of some supported ops in a [real-model](https://github.com/intel/webml-polyfill/tree/master/test/realmodel#3-supported-onnxjs-models) scenario
```
Note: Above 4 type tests were wrote with [Mocha test framework](https://mochajs.org/).
```
* [**IDL (Interface Definition Language) Tests**](https://github.com/intel/webml-polyfill/tree/master/test/wpt) in `wpt` folder which were generated by [idlharness.js API](https://web-platform-tests.org/writing-tests/idlharness.html)

Assistant tools:
* [**Accuracy Measurement**](https://github.com/intel/webml-polyfill/tree/master/test/tools/MeasureAccuracy) in `tool/MeasureAccuracy` folder, for checking accuracy of semantic segmentation inference result with inputing lots of images
* **CI (Continuous Integration)**  its baseline data is in `tool/CI` folder, for checking webml-polyfill repo's PRs, leveraging [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) tool testing on macOS platform, [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) tool testing on Linux platform and [AppVeyor CI](https://www.appveyor.com/) on Windows platform
* [**CTS Converter**](https://github.com/intel/webml-polyfill/tree/master/test/cts/tool/CTSConverter) in `cts/tool/CTSConverter` folder for converting [NN API CTS Tests](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/ml/+/refs/tags/android-cts-10.0_r2) to these CTS test cases for WebNN API
* [**PerLayer Analyzer**](https://github.com/intel/webml-polyfill/tree/master/test/tools/perLayerAnalyzer) in `tool/perLayerAnalyzer` folder, for running **Real Model Tests**, collecting and displaying each layer's performance to help analysing
* [**Regression Checker**](https://github.com/intel/webml-polyfill/tree/master/test/tools/RegressionChecker) in `tool/RegressionChecker` folder, for checking native backend implement PRs with high quality(avoiding new problems such as crash, freeze, etc.)


## Contribute CTS test case
The CTS tests in `./cts/test` folder were converted from original Android CTS test, for new created CTS test file, please add them into `./cts/test_supplement` folder

### Steps
Steps to update `./cts/test_supplement/cts_supplement-all.js`:
* Copy your test file into `./cts/test_supplement`.
* Change directory into `CTSConverter`:

    ```shell
    $ cd ./cts/tool/CTSConverter
    ```

* Update `./cts/test_supplement/cts_supplement-all.js` file:

    ```shell
    $ npm run combine
    ```

    or

    ```shell
    $ python3 ./src/main.py -s ../../test_supplement -o ../../test_supplement/cts_supplement-all.js
    ```
